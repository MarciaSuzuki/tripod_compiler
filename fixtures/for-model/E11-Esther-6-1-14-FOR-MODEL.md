No edict is voiced or written word-for-word here: the chronicle is summarised, and Haman's prescription for honour is private court-advice spoken to the king's face, not a promulgated law — so FORMAL_OFFICIAL does not apply (and the prescription is tagged ADVISES_COURSE_OF_ACTION, not PRESCRIBES_AS_LAW).
