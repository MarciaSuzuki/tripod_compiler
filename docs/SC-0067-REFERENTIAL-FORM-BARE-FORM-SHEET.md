# SC-0067 — Phase 1 (R1) — `referential_form` bare-form calibration sheet

> **RULED by Marcia 2026-06-20 (Evaluator re-verified the full 136 first).** Decision: **approve all
> §7 recommendations**, with two carve-outs —
> - **§2C Jonah divine-names:** strip to bare (`ELOHIM` / `YHWH` / `YHWH_ELOHIM`), alternation
>   preserved across slots; **HOLD `ELOHIM_TO_YHWH_SHIFT`** (a transition, not a form — untouched).
> - **§2D patterns:** **defer `ALTERNATES_MOTHER_IN_LAW_AND_NAOMI` and `NAMED_THEN_ADDRESSED` to
>   Phase 3** (untouched); strip the other 8.
>
> Net apply: **~30 strip-values + 1 drop** (the `SELF_REFERENCE_REFUSING_OWN_NAME` slot) across the FMs,
> with the coupled CL echoes + 2 divergent CL variants reconciled; **3 occurrences held/deferred**, the rest kept.
>
> **SCOPE EXTENDED — Marcia ruled Option A 2026-06-20:** R1 now covers **all surface-form slots**, not
> just `referential_form`. The newly-found **(a) surface-address family** is folded in (see **§10**, ruled);
> the `MY_DAUGHTER_INTIMATE` hold **dissolves** (it now strips to `MY_DAUGHTER` consistently in both
> families). The word-bearing **(b)** forms route to **Phase 2 (R2)** and the structural **(c)** forms to
> **Phase 3** — on record in §10D. Independently re-verified: the non-referential `*_form` landscape is
> **56 occ / 31 keys = (a) 24 + (b) 22 + (c) 10**.

> **Status (original): CALIBRATION — awaiting Marcia's word.** Nothing applied yet. This sheet enumerates
> every referential-form value across the 19 gold FOR_MODELs (FMs) — **all three key sub-families**
> (`referential_form`, `*_referential_form`, `referential_form_at_verse`), **136 occurrences total** —
> proposes the **bare surface form** per R1, and surfaces the boundary calls. After ruling, the
> changes land as **one compiler+vault pair** (FM amendments — string-replace + count assertion +
> re-grep + `amendments.json` record; vault byte-identical), with the coupled COMPILATION-LOG (CL)
> echoes updated in lockstep.

## The ruling being applied (R1, Marcia, locked)

> `*_referential_form` slots carry the **BARE SURFACE FORM** — the referring expression as it
> appears in the text. **Strip** the analytic/meta annotations (`KINSHIP_FORM`, `DIVINE_NAME`,
> `_OCCURRENCE`, `_NARRATOR_EPITHET`, `_RELATIONAL`, `_THIRD_PARTY_EPITHET`, `WITHHELD_PER_*`, …).
> The annotation's content is **already carried** structurally (B-codes / `B?`) or in a note-home
> (`significant_absence`, CL, lint-exception) — **preserve every blessed device; change ONLY the
> FM slot value.**

## Counts (from the fixtures, not memory — re-verified with the corrected family grep)

- **136** FM occurrences across **three** key sub-families. Re-grep
  (`grep -roE '"[a-z_]*referential_form[a-z_]*"'`) proves the set is exactly these three — no 4th:
  - scene-being `referential_form` — **81**
  - proposition event-slot `<participant>_referential_form` — **43**
  - positional `referential_form_at_verse` — **12** (10 distinct; **was missing from the first draft** —
    the original grep anchored the closing quote right after `referential_form`, so the suffixed key slipped through)
- **82** distinct FM values (was 75; the at_verse family adds **7 new FM strings** — 4 brand-new:
  `ESHET_CHAYIL_WOMAN_OF_WORTH`, `HE_PRONOMINAL`, `HUSBAND_OF_NAOMI`, `UNNAMED_DEITY_IN_BINDING_PAIRING`;
  + 3 previously-"CL-only" strings now FM-located: `SHE_PRONOMINAL`, `PROPOSED_NEW_NAME_MARA_IN_SELF_SPEECH`,
  `SELF_REFERENCE_REFUSING_OWN_NAME`).
- **19** CL `referential_forms[].value` entries (P01–P05). After the at_verse merge only **2** are
  truly CL-only, and both are divergent variants of an at_verse value (see §5).
- **84 distinct total** = 82 FM + 2 truly-CL-only.

## Disposition summary — R1 scope = referential family (136) + (a) surface-address (24) = 160 occ

| § | Disposition | Distinct | FM occ. | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **CLEAR STRIP** (R1-named annotation) | 13 | 20 | **Apply as proposed** |
| 2A–2D | **BOUNDARY** — `referential_form` + `*_referential_form` | ~19 | ~25 | Per the grouped asks below |
| 2F | **`referential_form_at_verse` sub-family** | 10 | 12 | 2 strip · 1 drop · 7 keep (3 edges) |
| 3 | **KEEP — `UNNAMED_`/`NON_NAME` family** (blessed) | 10 | 11 | **Keep** (CLAUDE.md §3.3) |
| 4 | **KEEP — already bare** (surface forms / translit-gloss) | ~33 | ~68 | **No change** |
| 5 | CL reconciliation | — | — | echoes track FM; CL-only → her call |
| 10 | **(a) surface-address family** (`address_form` + kin) | 17 | 24 | 7 strip · 5 keep · 5 boundary |

The referential family is 136 occ (81 + 43 + 12); the (a) surface-address family adds 24 occ. Word-bearing
(b, 22 occ) routes to Phase 2 (R2); structural (c, 10 occ) to Phase 3.

---

## §1 — CLEAR STRIP (recommend: apply as proposed)

R1 names the annotation explicitly, or the analytic tail is unambiguous. Bare form in **bold**.

| # | Current value | → Proposed bare form | FM locations | CL echo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `HER_HUSBAND_RELATIONAL` | **`HER_HUSBAND`** | P01 scene | P01 |
| 2 | `KINSHIP_FORM_YEBIMTEKH` | **`YEBIMTEKH`** | P03 scene + exemplar(×2) | P03 |
| 3 | `RUTH_THE_MOABITESS_NARRATOR_EPITHET` | **`RUTH_THE_MOABITESS`** | P07 scene + reporter | P04* |
| 4 | `RUTH_THE_MOABITESS_HER_DAUGHTER_IN_LAW_NARRATOR_EPITHET` | **`RUTH_THE_MOABITESS_HER_DAUGHTER_IN_LAW`** | P04 scene + accompanying | — |
| 5 | `SHADDAI_ARCHAIC_POETIC_DIVINE_NAME_FIRST_OCCURRENCE` | **`SHADDAI`** | P04 invoked_divine_agent | P04 |
| 6 | `SHADDAI_ARCHAIC_POETIC_DIVINE_NAME_SECOND_OCCURRENCE` | **`SHADDAI`** | P04 invoked_divine_agent | P04 |
| 7 | `YOUR_MOTHER_IN_LAW_KINSHIP_FORM` | **`YOUR_MOTHER_IN_LAW`** | P06 loyalty_act_toward | — |
| 8 | `YOUR_HUSBAND_RELATIONAL_PAIRING_WITHHELD_PER_P01_D2` | **`YOUR_HUSBAND`** | P06 after_whose_death | — |

**Clear by principle (analytic tail not in the literal seed list, but unambiguous):**

| # | Current value | → Proposed bare form | What is stripped | FM locations | CL echo |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | `CLOSED_BY_KINSHIP_FORM_HER_MOTHER_IN_LAW` | **`HER_MOTHER_IN_LAW`** | discourse-closure prefix + `KINSHIP_FORM` | P02 scene + kissed | P02 |
| 10 | `NAARA_MOABIYAH_THIRD_PARTY_EPITHET` | **`NAARA_MOABIYAH`** | `_THIRD_PARTY_EPITHET` | P05 scene | — |
| 11 | `NAAR_NITSAV_AL_HAQOTSRIM_NAMED_BY_ROLE` | **`NAAR_NITSAV_AL_HAQOTSRIM`** | `_NAMED_BY_ROLE` | P05 scene | P05 |
| 12 | `MY_DAUGHTER_INTIMATE` | **`MY_DAUGHTER`** | `_INTIMATE` (register tag; lives at register-override) | P08, P09, P10 scenes | — |
| 13 | `RUTH_THE_MOABITESS_LEGAL_NAMING_AT_PROCEEDING` | **`RUTH_THE_MOABITESS`** | `_LEGAL_NAMING_AT_PROCEEDING` (setting tail) | P12 scene | — |

`*` P04's CL echoes the **short** form `RUTH_THE_MOABITESS_NARRATOR_EPITHET`, but P04's FM uses the
**long** form (#4). See §5 — a pre-existing FM↔CL divergence to reconcile.

---

## §2 — BOUNDARY (needs Marcia's word)

Grouped into the families named in the work order plus the prose-in-disguise cases.

### 2A — Address/setting tails (recommend: STRIP to the bare referring expression)

| Current value | → Proposed bare form | Family | FM locations |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JONAH_SON_OF_AMITTAI_NO_TITLE` | **`JONAH_SON_OF_AMITTAI`** | `NO_TITLE` | J01 scene + recipient |
| `ADDRESSED_AS_YHWH` | **`YHWH`** | `ADDRESSED_AS` | J05 scene |
| `ADDRESSED_AS_SLEEPER` | **`SLEEPER`** (or `NIRDAM`?) | `ADDRESSED_AS` | J02 scene |
| `THIS_MAN_IN_PRAYER` | **`THIS_MAN`** | `IN_PRAYER` | J02 scene |

### 2B — The withholding family (recommend: STRIP; device's content already in a note-home)

| Current value | → Proposed bare form | Note-home that carries the content | FM locations |
|---|---|---|---|
| `COLLECTIVE_THE_DEAD_AND_NAOMI_NO_PAIRING_INFERRED` | **`THE_DEAD_AND_NAOMI`** | P02 CL note (line ~648): "without disclosing which daughter-in-law's hesed … pairing withheld per P01-D2" | P02 prior_hesed_targets |

### 2C — Jonah divine-name alternation (THEOLOGICAL — her call)

The J05 CL **explicitly defers** the "naming shifts" high-risk audit (an honest R1 placeholder, not
yet hand-authored). So these slots are currently the **richest record** of the Elohim/YHWH
alternation. Stripping to the bare names **preserves the alternation data** across slots (you can
still read `ELOHIM` at J04 vs `YHWH` at J05) and only drops the editorial commentary. **But this is
a load-bearing literary feature — surfacing before any drop.**

| Current value | → Proposed bare form | What is stripped | FM locations |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ELOHIM_NOT_YHWH` (×4) | **`ELOHIM`** | `_NOT_YHWH` (contrast; recoverable from the bare slots) | J04 scene ×4 |
| `ELOHIM_ALONE` (×3) | **`ELOHIM`** | `_ALONE` | J05 appointer ×2 + questioner |
| `YHWH_ELOHIM_DOUBLED` (×2) | **`YHWH_ELOHIM`** | `_DOUBLED` (the doubling *is* the two-name form) | J05 scene + appointer |
| `ELOHIM_TO_YHWH_SHIFT` | **decompose / her call** | describes a *transition*, not one form — needs the actual name at that slot | J05 scene |

> **Caveat to surface:** if Marcia wants the alternation commentary preserved as prose, we add a
> `significant_absence` / CL note-home **first**, then strip — never silently drop.

### 2D — Prose-in-disguise: sequence / pattern / "named-as" (recommend per-row; some may be Phase 3)

| Current value | → Proposed bare form | Why boundary | FM locations | CL echo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `THE_MAN_THEN_NAMED_BOAZ` | **`THE_MAN`** (+ naming noted structurally) | a progression ("the man → Boaz"), not one form | P07 scene | — |
| `NAMED_THEN_ADDRESSED` | **her call** | a progression | J03 scene | — |
| `ALTERNATES_MOTHER_IN_LAW_AND_NAOMI` | **her call** (pick one + note, or Phase 3) | a cross-text *pattern*, not a referring expression | P07 scene | — |
| `NAMED_AS_HUSBAND_OF_RUTH` | **`HUSBAND_OF_RUTH`** | `NAMED_AS_` meta-prefix | P12 scene | — |
| `NAMED_ONLY_AS_MOTHER_IN_LAW` | **`MOTHER_IN_LAW`** | `NAMED_ONLY_AS` (the "only" significance → note) | P07 scene | — |
| `DUAL_SPELLING_SALMAH_AND_SALMON` | **`SALMAH_AND_SALMON`** | `DUAL_SPELLING_` meta-prefix | P14 scene | — |
| `SELF_NAMED_HEBREW` | **`HEBREW`** (or `IVRI`?) | `SELF_NAMED_` meta-prefix | J02 scene | — |
| `BUT_I_CONTRASTIVE` | **`BUT_I`** | `_CONTRASTIVE` (the contrastive *ani* is the surface) | J03 scene | — |
| `DIVINE_NAME_FIRST_ON_RUTHS_LIPS` | **`YHWH`** | `DIVINE_NAME_` prefix + `_FIRST_ON_RUTHS_LIPS` salience (→ note) | P03 agent_named | P03 |
| `REFUSED_NAME_NAOMI_IN_RECALL` | **`NAOMI`** | the refusal is the B3-renaming, audited in P04-D8 + CL | P04 question_target | P04 |

### 2F — The `referential_form_at_verse` sub-family (12 occ. / 10 distinct) — the missing third family

R1 governs this family too (same axis, positional key). The deity-context and pronominal edges were
device-checked against the FM + CL before disposition.

| Value | FM loc | Disposition | → bare form |
|---|---|---|---|
| `STRIPPED_TO_HA_ISHAH` | P01×1 | **KEEP** — blessed (§3); extend its location list + count-assert | — |
| `HA_ISH_THE_MAN` | P09×2 | **KEEP** — already bare (§4); extend | — |
| `HA_ISHAH_THE_WOMAN` | P10×1 | **KEEP** — already bare (§4); extend | — |
| `ESHET_CHAYIL_WOMAN_OF_WORTH` | P09×1 | **KEEP** — bare Hebrew+gloss (*eshet chayil*, the 3:11 epithet) | — |
| `HUSBAND_OF_NAOMI` | P01×1 | **KEEP** — already-bare relational | — |
| `PROPOSED_NEW_NAME_MARA_IN_SELF_SPEECH` | P04×1 | **STRIP** (+1 real strip) — redundant with the prop's `action:PROPOSED` + `proposed_name:"Mara"` (FM lines 303–304) | **`MARA`** |
| `UNNAMED_DEITY_IN_BINDING_PAIRING` | P03×1 | **STRIP** — `_IN_BINDING_PAIRING` confirmed *not* a withholding-home: the deity is homed structurally in `invoked_divine_agent: B10` and the unnamed→named escalation in the CL's P03-D5 STRUCTURAL_CONTRAST entry. Blessed `UNNAMED_` stays. | **`UNNAMED_DEITY`** |
| `SHE_PRONOMINAL` | P01×1, P10×1 | **EDGE → recommend KEEP** — the pronoun *is* the surface form; load-bearing in P10's secrecy scene (`SECRECY_INJUNCTION` / `WITHHOLDS`, FM lines 47/75) | — |
| `HE_PRONOMINAL` | P10×1 | **EDGE → recommend KEEP** — same | — |
| `SELF_REFERENCE_REFUSING_OWN_NAME` | P04×1 | **EDGE → recommend DROP the slot** — names the *act*, not a referring expression; fully redundant with `action:REFUSED` + `refused_name:"Naomi"` (FM lines 295–296) | (drop) |

**Net for this family: +1 real strip (`→MARA`), +1 strip (`→UNNAMED_DEITY`), +1 drop, 7 keeps (3 already in the sheet).**

---

## §3 — KEEP: `UNNAMED_` / `NON_NAME` family (recommend: KEEP — blessed surface device)

CLAUDE.md §3.3 lists `UNNAMED_MAN_FROM_BETHLEHEM` and `STRIPPED_TO_HA_ISHAH` as **canonical
referential-form examples**. "Referred to by description, not named" is a legitimate surface
characterization, not analytic creep. **This is the P01-D2 lesson — do not treat a blessed device
as a leak.**

| Value | FM locations | CL echo | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UNNAMED_MAN_FROM_BETHLEHEM` | P01 scene | P01 | blessed in CLAUDE.md §3.3 |
| `UNNAMED_FIRST_SON` | P01 scene | P01 | |
| `UNNAMED_SECOND_SON` | P01 scene | P01 | |
| `UNNAMED_WIFE_OF_HEAD` | P01 scene | P01 | |
| `STRIPPED_TO_HA_ISHAH` | P01 scene | P01 | blessed in CLAUDE.md §3.3 |
| `UNNAMED_KING` | J04 scene | — | |
| `UNNAMED_PRAYING_I` | J03 scene | — | |
| `NEARER_REDEEMER_UNNAMED` (×2) | P09 scene ×2 | — | **boundary:** `UNNAMED` as a *suffix* (others use prefix) — normalize? |
| `THE_DEAD_UNNAMED` | P11 scene | — | suffix form |
| `PELONI_ALMONI_NON_NAME` | P11 scene | — | **boundary:** `peloni almoni` *is* the surface "so-and-so"; keep, or strip `_NON_NAME` → `PELONI_ALMONI`? |

**One small ask:** keep the family, but do you want prefix/suffix normalized (e.g.
`NEARER_REDEEMER_UNNAMED` → `UNNAMED_NEARER_REDEEMER`) for consistency? Recommend: leave as-is
(cosmetic), unless you want uniformity.

---

## §4 — KEEP: already bare (no change)

Surface forms, transliteration+gloss (e.g. `HA_ISH_THE_MAN`, `KALLAH_DAUGHTER_IN_LAW`,
`SHEM_HA_MET_NAME_OF_THE_DEAD`), and surface phrases (e.g. `ONE_OF_OUR_REDEEMERS`,
`DAUGHTER_IN_LAW_WHO_LOVES_YOU`, `OUR_BROTHER_ELIMELECH`). No analytic annotation present.

`NAMED` (16×, P04–P06) · `HA_ISH_THE_MAN` (6×) · `HA_ISHAH_THE_WOMAN` (2×) · `HA_MET_THE_DEAD` ·
`HAMETIM_THE_DEAD` · `THE_MAN_HA_ISH` (2×) · `KALLAH_DAUGHTER_IN_LAW` (2×) · `REDEEMER_GOEL` ·
`OUR_KINSMAN_MODA` (2×) · `HER_MOTHER_IN_LAW_CHAMOT` (2×) · `YOUR_MOTHER_IN_LAW_CHAMOT` ·
`RUTH_YOUR_SERVANT_AMAH` (2×) · `AMAH_SERVANT` · `SHEM_HA_MET_NAME_OF_THE_DEAD` (2×) ·
`THE_SAILORS_HAMMALACHIM` · `THE_MEN_HAANASHIM` · `CHIEF_OF_THE_SAILORS` · `THIS_MAN` ·
`THIS_YOUNG_WOMAN` · `WOMAN_COMING_INTO_HOUSE` (2×) · `DAUGHTER_IN_LAW_WHO_LOVES_YOU` (2×) ·
`ONE_OF_OUR_REDEEMERS` · `OUR_BROTHER_ELIMELECH` (2×) · `NAOMI_HER_MOTHER_IN_LAW` (2×) ·
`THE_MOABITE_WIFE_OF_THE_DEAD` (2×) · `RUTH_THE_MOABITE_WIFE_OF_MAHLON` · `GREATEST_TO_LEAST` ·
`BY_THE_WORD_OF_YHWH` · `YHWH` (2×) · `YHWH_MY_GOD` · `YHWH_THE_GOD_OF_ISRAEL`

**Three minor confirms (recommend keep as-is):**
- `NAMED` (16×) — the baseline "referred to by proper name." Keep as baseline? (Carrying the literal
  name instead — e.g. `NAMED_NAOMI` — would be a bigger scope change, not R1's intent.)
- `NAOMI_WHO_RETURNED_FROM_MOAB` (2×, P11) — descriptive, but it *is* the surface phrasing of
  Ruth 4:3 ("Naomi, who has returned from Moab"). Keep.
- `YELADIM_TENDER_CHILD` (P01) — `yeladim` + a connotation gloss ("tender"). Keep as translit+gloss?

---

## §5 — CL reconciliation (FM ↔ COMPILATION-LOG)

The CL `referential_forms[]` array (P01–P05 only) records what the drafter emitted. Its `source` /
`note` prose **is the note-home** for the stripped commentary (e.g. P04's "narrator returns to
Moabite epithet after withholding"), so stripping the FM value loses nothing.

**Coupled echoes (update in lockstep with the FM):** `HER_HUSBAND_RELATIONAL`→`HER_HUSBAND` (P01) ·
`CLOSED_BY_KINSHIP_FORM_HER_MOTHER_IN_LAW`→`HER_MOTHER_IN_LAW` (P02) ·
`KINSHIP_FORM_YEBIMTEKH`→`YEBIMTEKH` (P03) · `DIVINE_NAME_FIRST_ON_RUTHS_LIPS`→(2C/2D) (P03) ·
`SHADDAI_…_FIRST/SECOND_OCCURRENCE`→`SHADDAI` (P04; **dedup** to one `SHADDAI` entry) ·
`REFUSED_NAME_NAOMI_IN_RECALL`→`NAOMI` (P04) · `NAAR_NITSAV_AL_HAQOTSRIM_NAMED_BY_ROLE`→
`NAAR_NITSAV_AL_HAQOTSRIM` (P05).

**Pre-existing FM↔CL divergence:** P04 CL echoes `RUTH_THE_MOABITESS_NARRATOR_EPITHET` (short) but
P04 FM uses `…HER_DAUGHTER_IN_LAW_NARRATOR_EPITHET` (long). Recommend: set the P04 CL echo to the
FM's bare form `RUTH_THE_MOABITESS_HER_DAUGHTER_IN_LAW` so the two halves agree.

**At_verse coupling (these are the CL halves of `referential_form_at_verse` slots, not "CL-only"):**
three values I first listed as CL-only are the CL echoes of at_verse slots and move with their FM per
§2F — `SHE_PRONOMINAL` (CL P01 ↔ FM P01/P10 → **keep**), `PROPOSED_NEW_NAME_MARA_IN_SELF_SPEECH`
(CL P04 ↔ FM P04 → **`MARA`**), `SELF_REFERENCE_REFUSING_OWN_NAME` (CL P04 ↔ FM P04 → **drop**).

**Two divergent CL variants to reconcile to the FM bare form (the only truly CL-only entries left):**
- `HUSBAND_OF_NAOMI_FRAMING` (CL P01) → **`HUSBAND_OF_NAOMI`** — the FM at_verse is already bare; strip the CL `_FRAMING`.
- `UNNAMED_DIVINE_AGENT_IN_BINDING_PAIRING` (CL P03 — in the `referential_forms[]` array **and** cited
  in the P03-D5 decision prose) → **`UNNAMED_DEITY`** — matches the FM at_verse bare form and incidentally
  drops the "AGENT" role-jargon SC-0014 removed. Update **both** the CL array entry and the P03-D5 prose citation.

---

## §6 — Blessed devices preserved (verified present; NOT touched)

- **P06 wife-pairing withholding (P01-D2):** `after_whose_death: "B?"` (FM line 508),
  `significant_absence` "…the pairing is withheld per P01-D2…" (FM line 202), the meaning-map
  lint-exception keyed on the map Q&A "her husband (pair withheld; see P01-D2)"
  (`_spec/lint-exceptions.json`), and the P01/J01/P02/P06 CL `decision_id: P01-D2` — **all STAY.**
  Only the FM slot value at line 509 changes (`…WITHHELD_PER_P01_D2` → `YOUR_HUSBAND`).
- **P02 NO_PAIRING_INFERRED:** the withholding content lives in the P02 CL note (~line 648). Only
  the FM slot value changes (`COLLECTIVE_THE_DEAD_AND_NAOMI_NO_PAIRING_INFERRED` → `THE_DEAD_AND_NAOMI`).

---

## §7 — What I need from Marcia (the decisions)

1. **§1 clear strip (13 values / 20 occ.):** apply as proposed? *(recommend: yes)*
2. **§2A address/setting tails:** strip to bare? *(recommend: yes)* — and `ADDRESSED_AS_SLEEPER` →
   `SLEEPER` or `NIRDAM`?
3. **§2C Jonah divine-name alternation:** strip to bare names (`ELOHIM` / `YHWH` / `YHWH_ELOHIM`),
   alternation preserved across slots? And `ELOHIM_TO_YHWH_SHIFT` — decompose to which name, or hold?
   *(recommend: strip the first three; HOLD the SHIFT for decomposition)*
4. **§2D prose-in-disguise (10 values):** take the proposed bare forms? The two genuine *patterns*
   (`ALTERNATES_…`, `NAMED_THEN_ADDRESSED`) — strip to one form + note, or defer to Phase 3?
5. **§3 `UNNAMED_`/`NON_NAME`:** keep the family (recommend) — and normalize prefix/suffix, or leave?
   `PELONI_ALMONI_NON_NAME` — keep or strip `_NON_NAME`?
6. **CL reconciliation (§5):** the 2 divergent CL variants reconcile to the FM bare form
   (`HUSBAND_OF_NAOMI_FRAMING`→`HUSBAND_OF_NAOMI`, `UNNAMED_DIVINE_AGENT_IN_BINDING_PAIRING`→`UNNAMED_DEITY`)? — *recommend: yes*
7. **`referential_form_at_verse` sub-family (§2F — the family I'd missed):** apply the 2 strips
   (`→MARA`, `→UNNAMED_DEITY`)? And the 3 edges — *recommend: KEEP `SHE_PRONOMINAL` / `HE_PRONOMINAL`
   (pronominal surface, load-bearing in P10's secrecy scene); DROP `SELF_REFERENCE_REFUSING_OWN_NAME`
   (redundant with `action:REFUSED` + `refused_name`).*

---

## §8 — Phase-4 guard scope (recorded now so it isn't lost)

Now that R1 spans the whole surface-form set (referential family + (a) address family), the Phase-4
guard must work by **value-shape, not key-name**: flag an **analytic-tailed surface form under ANY
`*_form` key** (register/relational/positional/occurrence/epithet tails — `_INTIMATE`, `_DEFERENTIAL`,
`_RELATIONAL`, `_NARRATOR_EPITHET`, `_THIRD_PARTY_EPITHET`, `KINSHIP_FORM`, `_FIRST/SECOND_OCCURRENCE`,
`_SPELLING_AT_*`, `WITHHELD_PER_*`, `_NAMED_BY_ROLE`, …). It must **allow-list the blessed forms**
(`UNNAMED_*`, `STRIPPED_TO_HA_ISHAH`, `*_PRONOMINAL`) so a naive later pass cannot strip them, and it must
still match all three referential key-forms (`referential_form`, `*_referential_form`,
`*referential_form_at_verse`). (b) speech-content and (c) structural forms are out of R1's value-shape and
are handled by their own phases.

---

## §9 — NEW scope finding: the sibling `*_form` families (needs Marcia's word)

While applying §1 #12 (`MY_DAUGHTER_INTIMATE`), the per-value count-assert revealed the value also lives
in a **sibling slot family `address_form`** — a slot R1 did not enumerate (R1 / the verified sheet cover
the `referential_form` family only; the Evaluator confirmed "3 sub-families, no 4th"). A repo grep finds a
broad `*_form` landscape (~28 slot families). It splits three ways:

**(a) Surface-address forms — same axis-kind as `referential_form`; R1's principle applies identically.**
`address_form` (12 occ, 5 distinct) + close kin `addressed_form` / `directed_address_form` / `divine_address_form`:

| Value | Slot | → bare | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MY_DAUGHTER_INTIMATE` (×6) | address_form | `MY_DAUGHTER` | `_INTIMATE` register tag |
| `MY_DAUGHTERS_INTIMATE` (×3) | address_form | `MY_DAUGHTERS` | `_INTIMATE` |
| `MY_LORD_DEFERENTIAL` | address_form | `MY_LORD` | `_DEFERENTIAL` register tag |
| `MY_DAUGHTER_NON_KIN_ELDER_TO_YOUNG_FOREIGNER` | address_form | `MY_DAUGHTER` | relational-analysis tail |
| `PELONI_ALMONI_NON_NAME` | address_form | **keep** | surface "so-and-so" (= §3 keep) |
| `DAUGHTER_FORM_OF_ADDRESS` | addressed_form | `DAUGHTER`? | meta ("X form of address") — boundary |
| `SLEEPER` · `YHWH_MY_GOD` | directed/divine_address_form | **keep** | already bare |

**(b) Speech/content forms — R2 (Phase 2) territory:** `question_form` (9), `response_form`,
`report_variation_form`, `attestation_form`, `decree_authority_form`, `compliance_form`, `blessing_form`, …
(word-bearing — handle with the speech strip).

**(c) Structural forms — Phase 3 residue:** `binding_indefinite_place_form` (3),
`binding_demonstrative_place_form`, `vow_structural_form`, `listing_order_form`, `line_form`,
`movement_form`, `duration_form`, `tie_form`, … (surface constructions / structural markers).

**Recommendation:** extend R1 to **(a)** now, as part of this same pair (it resolves the `MY_DAUGHTER`
entanglement and keeps the bare-form cleanup coherent — ~5 strips: `MY_DAUGHTER` ×7-across-both-slots,
`MY_DAUGHTERS`, `MY_LORD`; keep `PELONI_ALMONI`, `SLEEPER`, `YHWH_MY_GOD`; `DAUGHTER_FORM_OF_ADDRESS` is a
boundary). Defer **(b)** to Phase 2 (R2) and **(c)** to Phase 3. The Phase-4 guard (§8) then widens to the
address-kin keys too, with the same blessed allow-list.

> **RESOLVED — Marcia ruled Option A (extend) 2026-06-20.** The ruled (a) family is §10. (Correction to
> the §9 estimate: address_form `MY_DAUGHTER_INTIMATE` is **×6** — P07/P08/P09/P10 — not ×7; total across
> both families = 9.)

## §10 — (a) surface-address family — RULED: extend R1 (Marcia, Option A, 2026-06-20)

R1's bare-form principle now covers the surface-address / referring-expression `*_form` slots.
**Independently re-verified from the files** (digit-inclusive grep — the earlier scan's value-regex skipped
digits, hiding the SALMAH/SALMON forms): non-referential `*_form` landscape = **56 occ / 31 keys**,
bucketed **(a) 24 · (b) 22 · (c) 10** (sums to 56). My classification matches the Evaluator's (b)/(c)
routing exactly.

### 10A — STRIP (R1 bare-form; per-value count-assert each)

| Key | Value | → bare | FM occ | CL reconcile |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `address_form` | `MY_DAUGHTER_INTIMATE` | **`MY_DAUGHTER`** | 6 (P07,P08,P09,P10) | — |
| `address_form` | `MY_DAUGHTERS_INTIMATE` | **`MY_DAUGHTERS`** | 3 (P02) | — |
| `address_form` | `MY_DAUGHTER_NON_KIN_ELDER_TO_YOUNG_FOREIGNER` | **`MY_DAUGHTER`** | 1 (P06) | **P06 CL prose, line 88** |
| `address_form` | `MY_LORD_DEFERENTIAL` | **`MY_LORD`** | 1 (P06) | **P06 CL prose, line 88** |
| `addressed_form` | `DAUGHTER_FORM_OF_ADDRESS` | **`DAUGHTER`** | 1 (P05) | — |
| `begotten_name_form` | `SALMAH_SPELLING_AT_4_20` | **`SALMAH`** | 1 (P14) | — |
| `begetter_name_form` | `SALMON_SPELLING_AT_4_21` | **`SALMON`** | 1 (P14) | — |

7 distinct / **14 occ**. **SALMAH/SALMON:** only the positional `_SPELLING_AT_4_2x` tail is stripped — both
spellings stay distinct (the verse already lives in the anchor), so the load-bearing dual spelling is preserved.

**Entanglement resolved:** `MY_DAUGHTER_INTIMATE` now strips to `MY_DAUGHTER` consistently in **both**
families (referential ×3 + address ×6 = **9 total**); the §9 hold dissolves. **CL reconcile (P06 only):**
the two P06 values are cited in CL prose (line 88) — bare the cited value, keep the explanatory prose
("non-kin elder to young foreigner" / "deferential") as the note-home. The TH_ code
`TH_ADONI_MY_LORD_DEFERENTIAL_FORM` (line 494) is an L3 registry code — out of R1 scope, untouched.

### 10B — KEEP (already bare / surface)
`directed_address_form: SLEEPER` · `divine_address_form: YHWH_MY_GOD` · `address_form: PELONI_ALMONI_NON_NAME`
(= §3 keep) · `role_form: ONE_OF_OUR_REDEEMERS` (= §4 keep) · `blessing_recipient_form: THE_MAN_WHO_TOOK_NOTICE`
(surface relative-clause, Ruth 2:19).

### 10C — BOUNDARY — place/lineage referring forms (her word; lean keep)
`doubled_place_form: EPHRATHAH_AND_BETHLEHEM` · `model_house_form: HOUSE_OF_PEREZ` · `line_form: TOLEDOT_OF_PEREZ` ·
`living_and_dead_form: ET_HACHAYIM_VEET_HAMETIM` — all surface phrases, **lean keep**. The one likely strip:
`destination_people_form: PEOPLE_PREVIOUSLY_UNKNOWN_TO_HER` → **`PEOPLE`**? ("previously unknown to her" is analytic).

### 10D — Routed out of R1 (on record for later phases)
- **(b) → R2 / Phase 2 (carry words, 22 occ):** `question_form` (9), `matched_action_form` (4),
  `binding_indefinite_place_form` (3), `witness_summons_form` (2), `response_form`, `blessing_form` (`BARUKH_YHWH`),
  `decree_authority_form`, `compliance_form`.
- **(c) → Phase 3 (structural residue, 10 occ):** `vow_structural_form` (`SIX_STEP_LADDER…` — the triage memory's
  own example), `movement_form`, `listing_order_form`, `duration_form`, `report_variation_form`, `attestation_form`,
  `acquired_from_form`, `tie_form`, `resulting_relation_form`, `binding_demonstrative_place_form`.
