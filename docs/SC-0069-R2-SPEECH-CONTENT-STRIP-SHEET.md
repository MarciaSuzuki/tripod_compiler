# SC-0069 — Phase 2 (R2) — speech-content strip calibration sheet

> **Status: APPLIED 2026-06-20 (compiler half, on branch — Evaluator application-verify + Marcia's merge word pending; vault `cp` pending).** See [`SC-0069-APPLY-RECORD.md`](SC-0069-APPLY-RECORD.md). This sheet enumerates every
> word-bearing speech/content slot across the 19 gold FOR_MODELs by **value-shape, not key-name**, and was
> draft-verified by the Evaluator (the §2A/§E/§K corrections). The change lands as **one compiler+vault pair**
> (drop the word-value, keep `speech_act` + structure; per-value count-assert + re-grep; vault byte-identical),
> mirroring the SC-0067 (R1) idiom.
>
> **THE RULINGS (locked, Marcia 2026-06-20):**
> - **§A speech-content + §B forms + §F-leave** — **APPROVED** ("Approve all three"; §A is the complete §K list).
> - **§C command/instruction content** — **DROP as speech**.
> - **§D load-bearing formulas** — **DROP with explicit sign-off** (recorded here as her bless).
> - **§E the P03 vow rungs** — **KEEP as structure → Phase 3** (Marcia chose the conservative pole (i)).
> - **CONDITION (Evaluator, confirms at apply):** the apply must explicitly **KEEP `agent_named`** — a
>   structural pointer (NONE / B-code), and `NONE` is **load-bearing** (the significant-absence of a named
>   agent; the P01↔P02 inverse the CLs flag). It is already never a drop candidate; the keep is made explicit.

> **SC-ID:** SC-0069 is the next free number (reconfirmed 2026-06-20 vs `SPEC_CHANGES.md` highest =
> SC-0068, `gh pr list` = 0 open). The oral-pipeline Stage 2 also eyes SC-0069 — **binding allocation
> happens at APPLY time** (the `SPEC_CHANGES.md` row is written then, with a re-check); if Stage 2
> lands first, R2 bumps to the next free.

> **This is [[tripod-sentence-token-triage]] Phase 2 (R2).** R1 (SC-0067) — the referential/address
> bare-form strip — is MERGED. R2 = the speech-content strip. Phase 3 (structural `*_form` + the 3 held
> values + controlled-verb decompositions) and Phase 4 (the value-shape guard) remain after this.

> **CORRECTED 2026-06-20 after the Evaluator's draft-verify (3 findings, all verified):** (1) the
> realized NOT_TO_BE_NORMALIZED is the FM **`preserve_form`** flag (SC-0030), not the CL keep-image notes
> — §2A rewritten, the apply-gate fixed; (2) that reframes §E (the vow rungs are `preserve_form=false` →
> dropping is *licensed*) into a genuine fork; (3) §A under-enumerated (the Jonah-2 psalm cluster +
> `future_role_second` were mis-shelved as structural) — **§K is now the complete, value-shape-proven
> inventory.** Corpus stays SAFE (the only 2 `preserve_form=true` ride on the R2-excluded `action` axis).

## 1. The ruling being applied (R2, Marcia, locked)

> **Speech/content slots carry ONLY `speech_act` + structure (the participants).** DROP the
> word-bearing content (the actual words of speech) — the words live in the Meaning Map.

## 2. The R2 safety (the crux — R2 is HIGHER loss-risk than R1)

R1 stripped meta-annotations whose meaning was already carried structurally. **R2 drops WORDS whose
only other home is the map.** So per value, **before any drop**:

1. **CONFIRM the content is in the Meaning Map.** If it isn't, dropping LOSES it → do NOT drop; surface.
2. **CHECK for a load-bearing / `NOT_TO_BE_NORMALIZED` flag.** Exact phrasing that must survive is
   preserved (kept / relocated), never silently dropped → surface.

**Drop ONLY when not-flagged AND confirmed-in-map.**

### 2A — The load-bearing-content gate (CORRECTED after the Evaluator's draft-verify)

**There IS a machine-checked "keep the exact wording" flag in the FOR_MODEL, and it — not the CL — is the
gate.** My first draft grepped `NOT_TO_BE_NORMALIZED` / "preserve phrasing" (the unimplemented README
note) and missed the live token. The Evaluator caught it; verified directly:

- **`preserve_form` — the realized NOT_TO_BE_NORMALIZED (SC-0030 two-axis fidelity, [[tripod-level3-purity-debt]]).**
  Each annotated element carries `preserve_meaning` (the claim must survive) × **`preserve_form`** (`true`
  = exact wording is **mandated**, do NOT re-word; `false` = "means, not mandate" — the Performer may
  re-realize the wording). `SPEC_CHANGES.md` (SC-0030) states it verbatim: *"`NOT_TO_BE_NORMALIZED`
  (unimplemented README note) is **superseded by the `preserve_form=true` pole**."* It lives **in the FM**
  (a top-level fidelity array whose entries `ref` a `{prop_id, slot, list_position}`) and is **ajv-validated**.
- **Empirical (whole corpus, machine-checked):** the fidelity layer is seeded on **P03/P04/P06 only**
  (SC-0030 deferred the held-7 seeding). There are exactly **two `preserve_form=true`** elements in all 19
  FMs — **P06 P11 `response_components` SECOND & THIRD** (Ruth's reply, 2:13). Both ride on the **`action`**
  slot (`STATED_THAT_HE_SPOKE_TO_HEART_OF_HIS_SHIFCHAH`, `STATED_SHE_IS_NOT_AS_ONE_OF_HIS_SHIFCHOT`), which
  **R2 excludes** (the controlled-action axis). **So R2 drops nothing that is `preserve_form=true` → the
  corpus is SAFE.** But the safety rests on the *flag*, not on the CL.
- **Two complementary, non-machine layers also protect speech:** (1) the **CL "REQUIRED/PREFERRED
  keep-image" notes** (47 of them — the P03 oath, the P06 kanaph, the P04 Shaddai) — a *reconstruction*
  directive that lives in the CL, not the FM slot; (2) the **Meaning Map**, the architectural home for
  speech — the words appear 3× (L2 prose + L3 Q&A + a `CB_`/`FIG_` anchor **with the Hebrew**:
  `בָּרוּךְ יְהוָה / "blessed be YHWH"`, `רוּת אֲמָתֶךָ / "Ruth your servant"`). **Map-presence held 100%**
  on the genuine-speech sample (§8; the Evaluator re-verified all 295 multi-word speech values).

> **Apply-gate (corrected), per candidate value, in order:** (1) is its element `preserve_form=true`? →
> **KEEP** (surface); (2) un-seeded FM (no fidelity layer)? → fall back to map-presence + CL keep-image;
> (3) confirmed-in-map and not flagged → **DROP**. The Phase-4 guard reads the FM `preserve_form` flag (§10).
> Exposure is concentrated in the **load-bearing formulas** (§D) and the **P03 vow** (§E) — surfaced below.

## 3. Method + counts (value-shape, from the fixtures — not memory)

Walked every `event_specific_slots` leaf (incl. nested `*_components[]`) across all 19 FMs. Excluded
structural IDs (`B##`/`PL`/`O`/`TM_`/`TH_`/`CB_`/`FIG_`/`I#`/`S#`/`P#`), the controlled axes
(`speech_act`, `action`, `proposition_kind`), and the R1 `*referential_form*` family. Tagged each value
**speech-context** if its proposition carries a `speech_act`.

- **559** non-structural slot-values; **436** in speech-context across **211** keys (excluding
  `list_position` 61 + the vow's structural participant slots leaves **375** classified below — §K is the
  complete per-key inventory):

| Bucket | occ / keys | what it is | §  | recommend |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Speech-content slots | **111 / 92** | the words of an utterance, in a content slot | A | **DROP** |
| (b) `*_form` speech forms | **13 / 4** | `question_form`/`witness_summons_form`/`response_form`/`decree_authority_form` | B | DROP (words-subset) |
| Command/instruction content | **54 / 17** | spoken imperatives (`commanded_step` 34 + kin) | C | **boundary — her call** |
| Load-bearing formulas | **15 / 8** | creed / confession / Hebrew oath / `BARUKH_YHWH` | D | **surface — explicit bless** |
| The P03 vow cluster | **11 / 5** | the six-step ladder (`matched_action_form` etc.) | E | **GENUINE fork** |
| Meta / analytic characterizations | **46 / 26** | `question_subject:JONAHS_ANGER`, `RHETORICAL_*` | F | **OUT of R2 → Phase 3** |
| Structural keep (ordinals/names/classifiers/R1-forms) | **108 / 45** | `step_order`/`given_name`/`blessing_content_kind`/`address_form` | G | **KEEP — not touched** |
| (c) structural forms + narrated events | **17 / 13** | `vow_structural_form`/`custom_act`/`worship_act` | — | **→ Phase 3** |

> The R2 **drop** core (§A + §B) = **124 occ**; with §C/§D/§E rulings it lands **~140–190 occ**. Plus
> `list_position` 61 + `step_order` 25 = 86 pure ordinals never touched. **§K lists every key** — no
> bucket is "representative"; word-bearing speech is the *default*, so nothing slips to an unnamed keep.

## 4. The worked example — what R2 does to a proposition (J02 P18, the sailors' prayer, Jonah 1:14)

**BEFORE** (current):
```jsonc
"proposition_kind": "APPEAL",
"event_specific_slots": {
  "petitioners": "B4", "petitioned_divine": "B2",
  "petition_components": [
    { "petition": "DO_NOT_LET_US_PERISH_FOR_THIS_MANS_LIFE", "speech_act": "DIRECTS_HEARER_NOT_TO_DO" },
    { "petition": "DO_NOT_LAY_INNOCENT_BLOOD_ON_US", "innocent_blood": "CB_0054", "speech_act": "DIRECTS_HEARER_NOT_TO_DO" }
  ],
  "petition_grounds": "YOU_YHWH_HAVE_DONE_AS_YOU_PLEASED",
  "petitioned_subject_referential_form": "THIS_MAN"
}
```
**AFTER R2** (drop the words; keep `speech_act` + every participant/anchor/referential):
```jsonc
"proposition_kind": "APPEAL",
"event_specific_slots": {
  "petitioners": "B4", "petitioned_divine": "B2",
  "petition_components": [
    { "speech_act": "DIRECTS_HEARER_NOT_TO_DO" },
    { "innocent_blood": "CB_0054", "speech_act": "DIRECTS_HEARER_NOT_TO_DO" }
  ],
  "petitioned_subject_referential_form": "THIS_MAN"
}
```
The words ("do not let us perish for this man's life…") are in the map (P01/§8 below); the FM keeps that
**two `DIRECTS_HEARER_NOT_TO_DO` petitions were addressed by B4 to B2, one anchored to `innocent_blood`
CB_0054**. (Open micro-question for §I: when a component reduces to bare `{speech_act}`, keep it as the
structural placeholder, or fold into a count? Recommend **keep** — it preserves the petition-count.)

---

## §A — Speech-content slots (recommend: DROP) — 92 keys / 111 occ (**complete list in §K**)

The value is the words of an utterance, in a content slot, in a proposition that records `speech_act` +
the speakers/addressees. **The first draft printed only this representative table and mis-shelved genuine
speech as "structural" — the Evaluator caught it:** the entire **Jonah-2 psalm imagery** (`cast_into` THE_DEEP,
`descended_to` ROOTS_OF_THE_MOUNTAINS, `overpassing_waters` BREAKERS_AND_WAVES, `engulf_extent`,
`weeds_wrapped_around`, `vow_payment`…) and a **sibling-split** (`future_role_first` was listed, its twin
`future_role_second` was not — the exact miss that bit R1). **§K is now the complete value-shape inventory.**
The table below stays as the readable exemplars:

| Key | example value(s) | peri | verse |
|---|---|---|---|
| `petition` | DO_NOT_LET_US_PERISH_FOR_THIS_MANS_LIFE · TAKE_MY_LIFE | J02,J05 | 1:14; 4:3 |
| `petition_grounds` | YOU_YHWH_HAVE_DONE_AS_YOU_PLEASED | J02 | 1:14 |
| `petition_content` | SPREAD_YOUR_WING_OVER_SERVANT | P09 | 3:9 |
| `question_content` | WHAT_ARE_YOU_DOING_ASLEEP · WHAT_SHALL_WE_DO_TO_YOU | J02 | 1:6,11 |
| `answer` | IT_IS_GOOD_THAT_IT_BURNS_TO_ME | J05 | 4:9 |
| `prayer_opening` | WAS_THIS_NOT_MY_WORD | J05 | 4:2 |
| `lament_content` | DRIVEN_FROM_BEFORE_YHWH_EYES | J03 | 2:4 |
| `self_identification` | I_AM_RUTH_YOUR_SERVANT | P09 | 3:9 |
| `disclosure` | A_REDEEMER_NEARER_THAN_I | P09 | 3:12 |
| `declared_ground` | YOU_ARE_A_REDEEMER | P09 | 3:9 |
| `assent_content` / `pledge_content` | ALL_THAT_YOU_SAY_I_WILL_DO | P08,P09 | 3:5 |
| `handoff_content` | HE_WILL_TELL_YOU_WHAT_TO_DO | P08 | 3:4 |
| `report_content` | ALL_THE_MAN_DID_FOR_HER | P10 | 3:16 |
| `desired_outcome` | SEA_QUIET_FOR_US | J02 | 1:11 |
| `refusal`/`repeated_reason`/`stated_reason` | CANNOT_REDEEM_FOR_MYSELF · LEST_I_RUIN_MY_OWN_INHERITANCE | P11 | 4:6 |
| `queue_basis`/`queue_position` | NO_ONE_BESIDES_YOU_TO_REDEEM · BOAZ_IS_AFTER_YOU | P11 | 4:4 |
| `selling_status` | FIELD_OFFERED_FOR_SALE | P11 | 4:3 |
| `outcome` | GOOD_LET_HIM_REDEEM · I_WILL_REDEEM_YOU | P09 | 3:13 |
| `oracle_pronouncement`/`oracle_deadline` | NINEVEH_OVERTHROWN · FORTY_DAYS_MORE | J04 | 3:4 |

…and the rest of the dedicated-content family (`command_rationale`, `hoped_outcome`, `confessed_content`,
`declared_identity`, `hope_marker`, `hoped_divine_turning`, `proposal_purpose`, `reason_for_errand`,
`stated_purpose`, `stated_rationale`, `nearness_statement`, `storm_ownership_admission`,
`comparison_summary`, `ascription_summary`, `hesed_comparison`, `matriarch_deed`, `future_role_first/second`,
`plant_lifespan`, `inhabitant_descriptor`, …). **All trace to map narration (§8). Recommend DROP.**

## §B — The (b) `*_form` speech forms (SC-0067 §10D) — 7 keys / 21 occ

Routed to R2 by the R1 sheet. Re-confirmed each is genuinely word-bearing speech, with two refinements:

| Key | values | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `question_form` | WHO_ARE_YOU · WHY_WOULD_YOU_GO_WITH_ME · IS_IT_GOOD_THAT_IT_BURNS_… · SHOULD_I_NOT_PITY_NINEVEH | **DROP the 6 word-values** |
| `question_form` | RHETORICAL_PROMISE_QUESTION · RHETORICAL_RECOGNITION_QUESTION · DOUBLED_WHERE_AND_WHERE_WORKED | **3 are META (not words) → §F, keep** |
| `witness_summons_form` | YOU_ARE_WITNESSES_TODAY (×2) | DROP (Boaz, 4:9) |
| `response_form` | WE_ARE_WITNESSES | DROP (elders, 4:11) |
| `blessing_form` | BARUKH_YHWH | **load-bearing → §D** |
| `decree_authority_form` | BY_DECREE_OF_KING_AND_NOBLES | DROP (Jonah 3:7); but see §D (formula-ish) |
| `matched_action_form` · `binding_indefinite_place_form` | I_WILL_GO… · WHERE_YOU_GO… | **the P03 vow → §E** |

## §C — Command / instruction content — the big-volume BOUNDARY (~12 keys / ~47 occ)

Spoken imperatives. `commanded_step` alone is 34 (YHWH's commission *get up, go to Nineveh, call out*;
the captain's *get up, cry out*; Naomi's *wash, anoint, put on garments, go down*; Boaz's *buy it,
redeem*). Plus `counseled_action`, `requested_action`, `reported_instruction`, `reported_directive`,
`granted_action`, `refused_action`, `prohibition`, `prior_prohibited_action`, `guarded_against`,
`protected_fact`, `purpose`.

**The decision:** these are literally the words spoken, AND they're in the map (§8: *"get up, go to
Nineveh"* etc.) — so the R2 ruling says drop. But they're terse, near-controlled, and sit adjacent to
the controlled `action` axis, so one could read them as "structure."

> **Recommendation: DROP** (consistent with the ruling — they are the words, and the map carries them;
> keeping them would re-admit prose the seed-freeze is meant to evict). **Marcia rules the boundary.**

## §D — Load-bearing formulas — the NOT_TO_BE_NORMALIZED class (surface; ~10 keys / ~17 occ)

These carry **CL keep-image flags and/or fixed liturgical/confessional phrasing** (often Hebrew). They
are **in the map** (with Hebrew) — so dropping does not lose them — but they are exactly the class the
safety rule says **surface for an explicit bless, never silent**.

| Key | value(s) | load-bearing because | map home |
|---|---|---|---|
| `blessing_form` | BARUKH_YHWH | Hebrew benediction (Ruth 4:14) | P13 `CB_0008` `בָּרוּךְ יְהוָה` ✓ |
| `oath_formula` | AS_YHWH_LIVES | fixed self-curse oath (3:13); CL "do not soften" | P09 prose ✓ |
| `divine_descriptors` | GOD_OF_HEAVEN · MAKER_OF_SEA · MAKER_OF_DRY_LAND | Jonah's confession creed (1:9) | J02 prose + B2 desc ✓ |
| `creed_attributes` | GRACIOUS · COMPASSIONATE · SLOW_TO_ANGER · ABOUNDING_IN_HESED · RELENTING_OF_EVIL | Israel's oldest creed (4:2) | J05 prose ✓ |
| `declared_thesis` | SALVATION_BELONGS_TO_YHWH | the book's thesis line (2:9) | J03 `CB_0056` + prose ✓ |
| `living_and_dead_form` | ET_HACHAYIM_VEET_HAMETIM | Hebrew merism (kept §10C, R1) | (R1-adjacent) |
| `empty_word_echo` | REQAM_NEGATED · `attention_marker` HINNEH | Hebrew echo / discourse marker | maps ✓ |

> **Fidelity status (corrected):** the formula FMs — J02, J03, J05, P09, P13 — are **un-seeded** (no
> `preserve_form` layer; SC-0030 deferred the held-7). So *none of §D carries a machine `preserve_form=true`
> flag* — their protection today is map-presence + the CL keep-image only. That's the un-seeded fallback
> (§2A gate step 2), which is exactly why §D is "surface for explicit bless" rather than auto-drop.
>
> **Recommendation: DROP from the FM with explicit bless** (the map + the CL keep-image are the homes;
> the FM slot is redundant) — **OR** keep these specific values as structured anchors if you'd rather the
> machine artifact still carry the formula. Either is safe; this is the class you should consciously rule.

## §E — The P03 vow cluster — a GENUINE fork (CORRECTED after the Evaluator's draft-verify)

Ruth's vow (1:16–17): P3 has 6 `vow_components` (the "six-step ladder"); each pairs
`binding_indefinite_place_form` (WHERE_YOU_GO/LODGE/DIE) with `matched_action_form` (I_WILL_GO/LODGE/DIE/BE_BURIED).

**The fidelity data licenses dropping the words — this is the correction.** My first draft recommended KEEP
on the strength of the CL "REQUIRED keep-image" note. But that note is a *reconstruction* directive; the
FM's own annotation is the opposite: SC-0030 marked the vow with **`preserve_form=false` on all six rungs**
(the "means, not mandate" license — the Performer MAY re-realize the wording), plus a `vow_structural_form`
**structure-flag carrying `preserve_meaning=true`** (the escalation MUST survive). And the step-type
sequence is **already encoded structurally** in `vow_structural_form: SIX_STEP_LADDER_PATH_LODGING_PEOPLE_GOD_DEATH_BURIAL`
(a (c)-form R2 does not touch → Phase 3) + `list_position` + `binding_domain`. So dropping the per-rung words
loses **nothing the fidelity model mandates**: meaning + structure + the ladder all survive; the words live
in the map.

So §E is a **genuine choice, not a foregone keep:**
- **(i) KEEP the rungs** as load-bearing structure (route to Phase 3 with the (c) forms) — conservative; honors
  the CL "keep-image" for reconstruction at the cost of leaving 6 near-identical components in the FM.
- **(ii) DROP the rungs' words** like the rest of R2 — **licensed by `preserve_form=false`**; the pairing-marker
  (`vow_structural_form`, which itself names all six step-types) is already present and Phase-3-kept, so the
  mirror is not lost.

> **Recommendation: either is consistent;** the FM's own `preserve_form=false` annotation actually leans
> toward **(ii) drop**. **Marcia rules.** (My first-draft "recommend KEEP" overstated it — `preserve_form=false`
> is the project's already-ruled word on this vow.)

## §F — Meta / analytic characterizations — OUT of R2 (→ Phase 3) — ~24 keys / ~43 occ

These **characterize** the speech, they don't quote it (confirmed: `IDENTITY_RECOGNITION_AND_STANDING` is
**not** verbatim in the map, §8). They are [[tripod-sentence-token-triage]] bin-1 clause-commentary —
a different cleanup. `question_subject` (analytic values: JONAHS_ANGER, ANGER_OVER_PLANT,
IDENTITY_RECOGNITION_AND_STANDING, DAUGHTERS_GOING_WITH_NAOMI…), `narrator_interior_access_scope`,
`epithet_voice_layer`, `name_known_status`, `oath_conditional_structural_force`, `quoted_prior_speech_act`,
`subsequent_speech_act_event`, `dissuasion_target`, `moab_naming_status`, `hesed_antecedent`,
`argument_role`, `creed_rhetorical_function`, the `RHETORICAL_*`/`DOUBLED_*` question_form metas.

> **Note:** `question_subject` is split — values like `WHAT_IS_YOUR_WORK` / `WHERE_DO_YOU_COME_FROM` ARE
> the question words (→ §A drop), while `JONAHS_ANGER` / `IDENTITY_RECOGNITION_AND_STANDING` are analytic
> topics (→ keep/Phase 3). The apply pass splits per value. **Recommendation: OUT of R2; defer to Phase 3.**

## §G — Structural keep — not touched by R2 (~225 occ)

Ordinals (`list_position` 61, `step_order` 25), proper names (`given_name`, `son_named`, `proposed_name`,
`refused_name`, `father_name/named`), structured classifiers (`blessing_content_kind` HESED/MENUCHA_REST,
`role_in_household`, `nominal_equation_half`, `binding_domain`, `hesed_holds`, `state_at_departure/return`
FULL/EMPTY, `fear_magnitude`, `intensity`), the R1-done (a) address forms (`address_form` 12, etc.), and
narrated-event descriptors (`worship_act`, `custom_act`, `seating_act`, … → Phase 3 if anything). **Not
speech-words. KEEP.**

## §8 — Map-presence evidence (the safety sample, verified by grep)

| Value | FM slot | Meaning-Map home (grep hit) | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| DO_NOT_LET_US_PERISH… | `petition` J02 | J02 L2 prose + Q&A "do not let us perish for this man's life" | in-map ✓ |
| WHAT_ARE_YOU_DOING_ASLEEP | `question_content` J02 | J02 "What are you doing, sleeper?" + Q&A | in-map ✓ |
| I_AM_RUTH_YOUR_SERVANT | `self_identification` P09 | P09 prose + `B9` desc `רוּת אֲמָתֶךָ` | in-map ✓ |
| SPREAD_YOUR_WING_OVER_SERVANT | `petition_content` P09 | P09 "spread your wing over your servant" (kanaf pair) | in-map ✓ |
| GO_TO_NINEVEH / ARISE | `commanded_step` J04 | J04 "get up, go to Nineveh" + Q&A | in-map ✓ |
| FIELD_OFFERED_FOR_SALE + queue | `selling_status` P11 | P11 "the portion… which Naomi… is selling… I am after you" | in-map ✓ |
| BARUKH_YHWH | `blessing_form` P13 | P13 `CB_0008` `בָּרוּךְ יְהוָה / "blessed be YHWH"` | in-map ✓ |
| GOD_OF_HEAVEN / MAKER_OF_SEA | `divine_descriptors` J02 | J02 "I fear YHWH, who made the sea" + B2 desc | in-map ✓ |
| GRACIOUS / COMPASSIONATE… | `creed_attributes` J05 | J05 "gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in hesed" | in-map ✓ |
| AS_YHWH_LIVES | `oath_formula` P09 | P09 "seals it with the oath: as YHWH lives" | in-map ✓ |
| SALVATION_BELONGS_TO_YHWH | `declared_thesis` J03 | J03 `CB_0056` + "salvation belongs to YHWH" | in-map ✓ |
| IDENTITY_RECOGNITION_AND_STANDING | `question_subject` P10 | **not verbatim** (analytic topic) | → §F, not a drop |

**100% of genuine-speech sample is in the map.** The one not-in-map value is analytic (§F), correctly
not a drop. The full per-value map-presence check is an **apply-time gate** (every dropped value re-grepped).

## §9 — What I need from Marcia (the decisions)

1. **§A speech-content slots (111 occ / 92 keys — the COMPLETE list is §K):** drop the words, keep
   `speech_act` + structure? *(recommend: yes — every value verified in-map; §A is now a vetted list, not a rule)*
2. **§B (b) `*_form` speech forms:** drop the word-values (`question_form` words, `witness_summons_form`,
   `response_form`)? — the 3 `RHETORICAL_*`/`DOUBLED_*` metas go to §F (keep). *(recommend: yes)*
3. **§C command/instruction content (~47 occ, incl. `commanded_step` ×34):** drop as speech, or keep as
   structured directive payload? *(recommend: drop — they are the words and they're in the map)*
4. **§D load-bearing formulas (15 occ — creed, confession, `AS_YHWH_LIVES`, `BARUKH_YHWH`,
   `SALVATION_BELONGS_TO_YHWH`):** these FMs are **un-seeded** (no `preserve_form` flag) → the gate is
   map-presence + CL keep-image. Drop-with-explicit-bless, or keep in the FM as structured anchors?
   *(recommend: drop-with-bless; either is safe)*
5. **§E the P03 vow cluster:** the rungs are **`preserve_form=false`** (re-rendering already licensed) and the
   ladder is already encoded in `vow_structural_form`. (i) KEEP as structure (Phase 3), or (ii) DROP the words?
   *(recommend: either is consistent — the FM's own fidelity flag leans toward (ii) drop)*
6. **§F meta/analytic (~43 occ):** confirm OUT of R2 → defer to Phase 3? *(recommend: yes)*
7. **Bare-component micro-rule (§4):** when a `*_components[]` entry reduces to `{speech_act}` only,
   keep it as the structural placeholder (preserves the count)? *(recommend: keep)*

## §10 — Phase-4 guard scope (recorded so it isn't lost)

The value-shape guard (SC-0067 §8) widens to flag **word-bearing content in any speech/content slot**:
a multi-word `UPPER_SNAKE` value rendering an utterance under a content key, in a proposition carrying a
`speech_act`. **It MUST read the FM `preserve_form` flag and never flag/drop a `preserve_form=true` element**
(the machine NOT_TO_BE_NORMALIZED gate, §2A). Allow-list the structural classifiers/ordinals/names and the
kept formulas (§D/§G) and the kept vow forms (§E) per Marcia's rulings. Bin-1 analytic commentary (§F) gets
its own Phase-3 rule.

## §K — Complete value-shape inventory (closes the Evaluator's completeness finding)

Every speech-context key, bucketed. **Nothing is "representative":** word-bearing speech (§A) is the
*default* bucket, so a key only leaves §A by appearing in an explicit keep/meta/structural list. Borderline
§A↔§G keys are flagged `⚠` for confirmation at apply. (`list_position` 61 + the vow's structural participant
slots are pure structure, excluded from all of the below.)

explicitly per the Evaluator's apply condition; **`agent_named: NONE` is load-bearing** — the significant-absence
of a named agent, the P01-famine/deaths ↔ P02-YHWH-gives-bread structural inverse the CLs flag).
